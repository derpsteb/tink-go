# Tink Golang

<!-- copybara:tink_placeholder(Build badges) -->

Using crypto in your application [shouldn't have to][devs_are_users_too_slides]
feel like juggling chainsaws in the dark. Tink is a crypto library written by a
group of cryptographers and security engineers at Google. It was born out of our
extensive experience working with Google's product teams,
[fixing weaknesses in implementations](https://github.com/google/wycheproof),
and providing simple APIs that can be used safely without needing a crypto
background.

Tink provides secure APIs that are easy to use correctly and hard(er) to misuse.
It reduces common crypto pitfalls with user-centered design, careful
implementation and code reviews, and extensive testing. At Google, Tink is one
of the standard crypto libraries, and has been deployed in hundreds of products
and systems.

To get a quick overview of Tink's design please take a look at
[Tink's goals](https://developers.google.com/tink/design/goals_of_tink).

The official documentation is available at https://developers.google.com/tink.
